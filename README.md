## Environment Variables üîë

Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following environment variables:

```
API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="YOUR_LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"  # For LangSmith tracing
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true" # For LangSmith tracing
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="YOUR_LANGCHAIN_PROJECT" # For LangSmith tracing
```

Replace `"YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"`, `"YOUR_LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"`, and `"YOUR_LANGCHAIN_PROJECT"` with your actual API keys and project name.  **Do not commit this file to your repository.**

## Troubleshooting üêõ

  - **API Key Issues:** Ensure your  API key is correctly set in the `.env` file.
  - **YouTube Loading Errors:** The app attempts multiple methods for YouTube content. If one fails, it tries others.  Check the error messages for details.
  - **Dependency Issues:** Double-check that all required packages are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - **Streamlit Issues:** Refer to the Streamlit documentation for troubleshooting Streamlit-specific problems.
